[Task1a](https://github.com/MihawkHu/DCASE2020_task1/tree/master/task1a) | [Task1b](https://github.com/MihawkHu/DCASE2020_task1/tree/master/task1b) | [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08389)


## Introduction
This is an implementation of [DCASE 2020 Task 1a](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification#subtask-a) and [DCASE 2020 Task 1b](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification#subtask-b) on **Acoustic Scene Classification with Multiple Devices**. We attain 2nds for both Task-1a and Task-1b in the official challenge 2020.  [Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08389).

We sincerely thank all the team members and advisors from [Georgia Tech ECE](https://chl.ece.gatech.edu/), [Tencent Media Lab](https://avlab.qq.com/#/index), [USTC](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~jundu/), and [Univeristy of Enna](https://www.unikore.it/index.php/it/ingegneria-informatica-persone/docenti-del-corso/itemlist/category/1589-siniscalchi).


## Experimental results
### Task 1a
Tested on [DCASE 2020 task 1a development data set](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification#subtask-a). The train-test split way follows the official recomendation.  

| System       |   Dev Acc. | 
| :---         |      :----:   | 
| Official Baseline     | 51.4%  | 
|  10-class FCNN  | 76.9%    | 
|  10-class Resnet  | 74.6%    | 
|  10-class fsFCNN  | 76.2%    | 
|  Two-stage ensemble system  |  81.9%   | 


### Task 1b
Tested on [DCASE 2020 task 1b development data set](http://dcase.community/challenge2020/task-acoustic-scene-classification#subtask-b). The train-test split way follows the official recomendation.  

| System       |   Dev Acc. (size)<br> Original model| Dev Acc. (size) <br> Quantization | 
| :---         |      :----:   | :---: | 
| Official Baseline     | 87.3% (450K)   |  - | 
|   Mobnet  | 95.2% (3.2M)    | 94.8% (411K) | 
|   small-FCNN    |  96.4% (2.8M)    | 96.3% (357K) | 
|   Mobnet + small-FCNN-v1   | 96.8% (1.8M+1.9M)      | 96.7% (497K) | 
|   small-FCNN-v1 + small-FCNN-v2   | 96.5% (1.9M+2.1M)     | 96.3% (499K)| 


## How to use

### Task 1a
Please refer to the `README.md` in `./task1a/` for detailed instructions.

### Task 1b
Please refer to the `README.md` in `./task1b/` for detailed instructions.

### Pre-trained models
Pre-trained models are provided in `./task1a/3class/pretrained_models/`, `task1a/10class/pretrained_models/`, and `./task1b/pretrained_models/`. You can get reported results by directly evaluate pre-trained models.
